# Kiki

A command-line interface to track package shipment

At the moment, this only supports Eurodis, since that's the only package I've
had to track, but as I see how more companies handle this stuff, I'll make
this smarter and eventually break it into a library.

## Colophon

This project is named for the title character in Hayao Miazaki's beautiful
[Kiki's Delivery Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiki%27s_Delivery_Service).
If you haven't seen it already, you should really do that.
